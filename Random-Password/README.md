The application also includes a password strength indicator and a convenient copy-to-clipboard feature with a confirmation message.

## Features

- Character Type Selection: Options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in the password.
- Password Strength Indicator: Password strength is displayed as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong," based on length and character variety.
- Copy to Clipboard: Users can easily copy the generated password to the clipboard, with a confirmation message displayed upon successful copy.
